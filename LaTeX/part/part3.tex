\chapter{Transient Performance of Various Geomatric Machines}
\label{C_Kapitel}
\noindent In this chapter we will use the programming language to implement these mathmaticall models from the simple individual machine to multi-machine and attempt to get the transient performance. In the second section, we will try to analysis the difference between this work and another one. 

We choose to use python as the implementation language because python is a interpreted, general-purpose and object-oriented programming language. With its extensive mathmatics library and other third-party library, it is very popular to be used as a scientific scripting language to aid in a numerical data processing and manipulation problem like this.

\section{Result Analysis}
\noindent There's no apparently difference between the work of this paper and \cite{chen2015transient} in one machine mode, but it shows difference in two-machine lines especially in $ST_2(n)$ and $BL_1$ these two parameters. From the Figure \ref{2_c} can we tell the differece. And in the four-machine lines model there are more difference shown in Figure \ref{differece four}.


% a significant difference can be found between the Figure~\ref{two machine bl and st} and the original Figure~\ref{st_bl_origin}

For the reasons of these difference, we suppose a few points: First, we doubt that whether the lack of enough quantity of samples cause the problem. But when we enlarege the quantity of simulation time from 10000 to 100000, we found no apparent difference from the result. Second, due to that we don't know what kind of programming language the reseachers coding with, a probable cause may be we take a different platform to programm with, and that may cause some accuracy problem. Third, we also doubt that the researchers may do some kind of curve smoothing in oder to present a perfect result.
